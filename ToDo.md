# Things to do:
- Workflow
- Wiki
- add comments to code  (PRIO LOW :))
- crashmanagement (to prevent data loss)
## Design
- Portability (also testing)
## Input
- Multiple accounts (PRIO VERY HIGH)

- Optional: search button categories (MEDIUM)
- Enable import for all major banks (PRIO VERY HIGH) 
- exclude? /> Savings (spaargeld is natuurlijk wel een belangrijke, exclude is niet perse sparen, sparen is wel een unieke rekening) (PRIO LOW)
## Output (brainstorming here)
 -For now to my opinion there enough output things (graphs). The nibud graph needs more options added to fit the  family situation (PRIO HIGH)
- zoom functions, wold be really nice, but i think work intensive (PRIO LOW)

## workflow
- Introduction? Would be nice (MEDIUM PRIO)
- Some presets) for now not a prio. It is now optimized for manual optimiation, with the advantage of ontrol forthe user. If done it should de done right, aand that is i think a lot of work (MEDIUM PRIO)
