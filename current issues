to not forget here a list of current issues:
-what to do with one- offs and other anomalies
-how many layers, of categories and sub categories, and how to manage them / current thought, just follow nibud structure, income 2 levels, 
expenses three levels. And no felxibilty (no composite pattern) herein. Expenses that have no more depth then 2 levels, get a extra level 
with the same name to easily sum over sub2 categories and sub3 categories
-how to make the gui look nice
