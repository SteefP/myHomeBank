# myHomeBank

An offline tool to get a better insight in your finances. You download a transactionsfile from your bank (ie CSV or text) and import it in the tool. Then you can categorize, edit and make graphs.

Goal of the project is mainly practice and have fun for myself, and secondly offcourse to add the functionalties that I think professional applications lack :) or at least model it to my preferences.

This is version 2 of the project, it is now more or less in a MVC structure, and grahics have improved and the main functionality is there.  

If you like to try to use it, just downlaod the zip file.
