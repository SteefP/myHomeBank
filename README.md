# myHomeBank

An offline tool to get a better insight in your finances. You download a transactionsfile from your bank (ie CSV or text) and import it in the tool. Then you can categorize, edit and make graphs.

Goal of the project is mainly practice and have fun for myself, and secondly offcourse to add the functionalties that I think professional applications lack :) or at least model it to my preferences.

So far the project is in the fase proof of concept. It is written in spaghetti code and the main functionality is there. Next step is to put in MVC architecture and make it look better!
