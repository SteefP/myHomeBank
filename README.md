An offline tool to get a better insight in your finances an enable you to compare your spendings to other dutch people. The Nibud (a Dutch institution) is used as a starting point for categories. When you have categorized all your transactions you will have a categorized personal budget overview. 

The input for the application is a transactionsfile from your bank (ie CSV or text) which can be downloaded on their website. The data is imported in the tool and categorized by the user. 

Goal of the project is mainly practice and have fun for myself, and secondly to give users the ability to quickly gain insight into their personal budgets. The output can be used to compare your personal budgets to the dutch population by using the NIBUD tool. 

At this moment the project is in alpha stage and as such might not function fully of not at all.
